Set Collector is an add-on for World of Warcraft that allows the player to view various gear/transmogrification sets on their character and track the progress of their appearance collection.

## Changes for Dragonflight

Thank you to everyone who has expressed interest in this project! We have updated SetCollector for Dragonflight.

With Dragonflight, sets and their variants are no longer exclusively associated with a single SetCollector Collection type. We are exploring options to support filtering sets and variants by these collection types without having to break up the sets.

## Localization

## Key Features

Players are able to view a list of collections (e.g., Raid, Dungeon or PvP) and their sets (e.g., BfA Season 1/Shaman/Horde) to select for preview. If there are multiple variants of the sets (e.g., Raid Finder/Normal/Heroic or Aspirant/Gladiator) then each variant is available for preview as well.

The list of sets is filtered by the activated specialization by default, but also allows for viewing off-spec sets or all sets for the class or armor type. It can also be filtered by sets marked as favorite. Right-click on the set or an unselected variant to mark it as a favorite. You can also filter by whether then set can be obtained or used for transmogrification.

In addition, Set Collector allows the player see their progress toward completing each set and set variant. A check mark will be displayed to show whether you have completed any or all of the variants in the set.

Set Collector also has key binding available to launch the UI. Currently located in the Other category in the Key Binding interface. Other options can be set in the Interface options.

## Included Gear Sets

Current gear sets in Set Collector include:

* Legendaries
* Raid sets

* Mythic Keystone/Challenge Mode Dungeon Sets (Mists of Pandaria)
* PvP sets (Seasons 14 to present)
* Expansion-Specific Sets (e.g., Garrison and War Campaign Sets)
