# SetCollector

Set Collector is an add-on for World of Warcraft that allows the player to view various gear/transmogrification sets on their character and track the progress of their appearance collection.

## Changes for Shadowlands

Thank you to everyone who has expressed interest in this project! We have access to the Shadowlands Beta and have begun preparing Set Collector for its release.

Here are some of the tentative changes planned for the Shadowlands release of Set Collector:

* Set Collector will only show sets from starting zones, Battle for Azeroth, Shadowlands, and holidays by default. This is to manage the size of the list and align with the new leveling experience.
* Additional set from other expansions can be added/enabled from the Set Collector Addon settings. Possibly through chat command as well.
* The Garrison Collection has been renamed to Expansion and will include sets obtain from expansion-specific features, such as Garrisons, Class Halls, and Warfronts.

## Key Features

Players are able to view a list of collections (e.g., Raid, Dungeon or PvP) and their sets (e.g., Tier 15/Shaman/Melee) to select for preview. If there are multiple variants of the sets (e.g., Raid Finder/Normal/Heroic or Red/Blue) then each variant is available for preview as well.

The list of sets is filtered by the activated specialization by default, but also allows for viewing off-spec sets or all sets for the class or armor type. It can also be filtered by sets marked as favorite. Right-click on the set or an unselected variant to mark it as a favorite. You can also filter by whether then set can be obtained or used for transmogrification.

In addition, Set Collector allows the player see their progress toward completing each set and set variant. A check mark will be displayed to show whether you have completed any or all of the variants in the set.

Set Collector also has key binding available to launch the UI. Currently located in the Other category in the Key Binding interface. Other options can be set in the Interface options.

## Included Gear Sets

Current gear sets in Set Collector include:

* Legendaries (Classic through Legion)
* Raid Tier sets (Tier 1 through Tier 19)
* Dungeon sets (1-3 as well as AQ sets)
* Mythic Keystone/Challenge Mode Dungeon Sets (Mists of Pandaria)
* PvP sets (Seasons 14 through Legion Season 1)
* Expansion-Specific Sets (e.g., Garrison and War Campaign Sets)
