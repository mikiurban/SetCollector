Set Collector is an add-on for World of Warcraft that allows the player to view various gear/transmogrification sets on their character and track the progress of their appearance collection.

## Changes for Shadowlands

Thank you to everyone who has expressed interest in this project! We have updated SetCollector for Shadowlands.

Here are some of the changes for the Shadowlands release of Set Collector:

* Set Collector will now allow sets from an entire expansion to be hidden using the Set Collector Addon settings (Interface > Addons > Set Collector). You can also enable/disable expansions through chat command as well. E.g., to toggle the Legion setsÂ `/setcollector version 7`
* Two commonly requested features are now here and may be set in the Interface options:
  * The Set Collector UI can be undocked and moved.
  * The setting to show/hide the minimap icon is now global and shared by all characters.
* The Garrison Collection has been renamed to Expansion and will include sets obtained from expansion-specific features, such as Garrisons, Class Halls, and Warfronts.
* Character filters (e.g., Show only favorite sets) can now be seen and modified in Interface options.
* Raid and PvP sets will now display the raids and pvp seasons the sets were obtained from.

## Key Features

Players are able to view a list of collections (e.g., Raid, Dungeon or PvP) and their sets (e.g., BfA Season 1/Shaman/Horde) to select for preview. If there are multiple variants of the sets (e.g., Raid Finder/Normal/Heroic or Aspirant/Gladiator) then each variant is available for preview as well.

The list of sets is filtered by the activated specialization by default, but also allows for viewing off-spec sets or all sets for the class or armor type. It can also be filtered by sets marked as favorite. Right-click on the set or an unselected variant to mark it as a favorite. You can also filter by whether then set can be obtained or used for transmogrification.

In addition, Set Collector allows the player see their progress toward completing each set and set variant. A check mark will be displayed to show whether you have completed any or all of the variants in the set.

Set Collector also has key binding available to launch the UI. Currently located in the Other category in the Key Binding interface. Other options can be set in the Interface options.

## Included Gear Sets

Current gear sets in Set Collector include:

* Legendaries
* Raid sets
* Dungeon sets
* Mythic Keystone/Challenge Mode Dungeon Sets (Mists of Pandaria)
* PvP sets (Seasons 14 to present)
* Expansion-Specific Sets (e.g., Garrison and War Campaign Sets)
* Crafted sets
* Other Sets incl. Holiday sets (Not necessarily transmog. Just for fun)
